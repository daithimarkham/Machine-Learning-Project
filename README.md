# Machine-Learning-Project
Create a web service that uses machine learning to make predictions based on the data set Power Production. The goal is to produce a model that accurately predicts wind turbine power output from wind speed values, as in the data set. You must then develop a web service that will respond with predicted power values based on speed values sent as HTTP requests.
