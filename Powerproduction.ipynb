    "### Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project you must create a web service that uses machine learning to make predictions based on the data set powerproduction. The goal is to produce a model that accurately predicts wind turbine power output from wind speed values, as in the data set. You must then develop a web service that will respond with predicted power values based on speed values sent as HTTP requests. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your submission must be in the form of a git repository containing, at a minimum, the following items:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Jupyter notebook that trains a model using the data set. In the notebook you should explain your model and give an analysis    of its accuracy.\n",
    "2. Python script that runs a web service based on the model, as above.\n",
    "3. Dockerfile to build and run the web service in a container.\n",
    "4. Standard items in a git repository such as a README.\n",
    "5. Can add more than one model if you like. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is the Powerproduction Dataset?**\n",
    "\n",
    "We will base our model on values which we are given in a dataset, wind turbine power output from wind speed values. Wind energy has emerged as a promising alternative source for overcoming the energy crisis in the world, and will help reduce the carbon footprint. Wind Power is a rapidly growning renewable energy source, this will only continue to grow due to concerns about climate warming. \n",
    "\n",
    "The uncertain nature of wind and high penetration of wind energy in power systems are a big challenge to the reliability and stability of these systems. To make wind energy a reliable source, accurate models for predicting the power output and performance monitoring of wind turbines are needed. We will create models below based on the values we already have, train the algorithm, and if a different wind speed is given, what will the that power output be. So basically, will forecast how much power you will use when the wind is a certain speed.\n",
